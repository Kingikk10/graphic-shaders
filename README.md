# graphic-shaders
Post Mortem
This project was very difficult for me. i followed along durning the lectures and understood the concepts, however i couldnt put them into practice. i looked up shaders such as glow and tried to implement however it was hard to get into the existing project. it would just cause green shapes and not add effects. i messed with alot of the project files and couldnt get any desired effects. i reverted alot to get to a build able state.
